This is a script to extract vocabulary list for pleco flashcards out of a series of subtitles files in traditional mandarin (here placed in the folder: subtitles). I am using ckiptagger to cut the words and extract places and people from the subs. You find how to install ckiptagger here: https://github.com/ckiplab/ckiptagger

The result are different txt files, with or without hsk4. List per episode or total,etc. They all can be imported into pleco flashcards

(WORK IN PROGRESS)
